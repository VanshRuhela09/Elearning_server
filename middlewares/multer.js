//we used the multer Because Express (and body parsers like express.json() or express.urlencoded()) can only handle text-based data â€” not binary data like files.

const storage = multer.diskStorage({  //This function defines custom storage settings.
  destination(req, file, cb) { // here file is when the user uploads the file that file will appear here in file variable
    cb(null, "uploads");

    const id = uuid();  //generate the unique id

    const extName = file.originalname.split(".").pop(); // extracting the file extension

    const fileName = `${id}.${extName}`; //new name of file

    cb(null, fileName);  //Passes the new filename back to Multer.
  },

export const uploadFiles = multer({ storage }).single("file");  // now upload the file to local storage 
//this middleware also put the file in req.file (request object)
